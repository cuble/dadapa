1. the event will stop after the callback finishes. However, you can "skip" an event with event.Skip() to make it go through the hierarchy of event handlers.	

2. study it by demo 

3. use GUI2EXE to transfer the py program to exe on Windows
    download vc2008 redist file from http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29, install it
      copy the manifest file amd64_microsoft.vc90.crt.xx9.0.21022.8yy.manifest in C:\Windows\winsxs\Manifests to C:\Python27\DLLs
      copy the msvcp90, msvcr90, msvcm90 DLLs in C:\Windows\winsxs\amd64_microsoft.vc90.crt.xx9.0.21022.8yy to C:\Python27\DLLs
	get suitable version of py2exe installation package from py2exe.org, install it.
	get GUI2EXE from: http://code.google.com/p/gui2exe/
	Run GUI2Exe.py directly
		select the start point .py file 
		set both Optimize and Compressed to 2, set Bundle Files to 3
		add the manifest file in C:\Python27\DLLs into "Other Resources" at bottom right
		click "Compile" at bottom right
	The EXE will be generated in the dist folder in your startup point .py file located folder
	    If GUI2Exe didn't copy the manifest file and the microsoft DLLs into the dist folder, do it yourself
	    If GUI2Exe didn't copy the icon file into the dist, do it yourself
