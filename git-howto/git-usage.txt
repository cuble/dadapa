1. Installation:
  Fedora Linux: sudo yum install git
  Windows: http://msysgit.github.com/
  
  
2. Available online git repository: https://github.com
  Created my account: fouryu@sina.com.cn
  Set my account username: cuble

3. Configure git locally:
  3.1 generate my RSA key: 
    generate_my_key.sh
    Note: the Email info and passphrase in the shell script should be changed accordingly.
  3.2 upload the RSA key to github: 
    github->account settings->SSH Keys->Add SSH Key
    copy the whole content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to "Key" part of the github webpage.
  3.3 test connection to github: 
    ssh -T git@github.com
    reply yes to the command prompt
    find the passphrase from the generate_my_key.sh script. Or use ssh-agent to auto input the passphrase: http://help.github.com/ssh-key-passphrases/
  3.4 Setup my information
    Configure global user information which used for all the folders working with git.
      git config --global user.name "Chen Gang-Cuble"
      git config --global user.email "fouryu@sina.com.cn"
    You also can configure a different user for a particular repository
      cd a_particular_repo
      git config user.name "fouryu"
      git config user.email "fouryu@github.com"

4. Start a project on github:
  4.1 for proxy needed environent we can access github via https instead of the ssh and set proxy for git.
      git config --global http.proxy http://proxyserver.com:port
  4.2 Create the repo on github webpage and initialize the project locally:
    create repo my-project remotelly
    mkdir my-project
    cd myproject
    git init
    git touch README
    git add README
    git commit -m 'first commit'
    git remote add origin git@github.com:cuble/my-project.git
    (for proxy needed environent: git remote add origin https://cuble@github.com/cuble/my-project.git)
    git push -u origin master
      Enter your pasphrase you set during ssh-keygen in case you add git@...
      Enter your github account password in case you add https://..., the password can be added in the url: https://cuble:mypassword@github.com/cuble/my-project.git

5. Work on with github:  
   5.1* git log: check commit hitstory. Try: git log --pretty=format:"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]" --graph --date=short.
       *git log -p -2: display the detailed change history of last two commit
       *git log --stat: display the change overview of each commit
   5.2* git pull: fetch from and merge with another repository. git pull is shorthand for "git fetch" followed by "git merge FETCH_HEAD".
   5.3* git add: to add a file or a change to be staged in a git repo. "git add ." to stage all the changed files, which include added and modified, in the project directory. 
   5.4* git diff: show differences between your current working files and the files staged to git. 
        *git diff --cached: show difference between staged files and committed files. "git diff --staged" has the same function.
        *git diff <hash1> <hash2>: show differences between the two commit. We only need short hash value which long 6 char.
   5.5* git commit -m "msg": commit the staged changes to the local git version control. git commit -a, is a combined of "git add changed_files" and commit.
        git commit --amend -m "more msg amend to the previous commit"
   5.6* git rm: stage a file to be removed from the version control system.
   5.7* git reset: to unstage changes, "git reset file" to unstage the changes on the file. 
   5.8* git status: check the status of the working copy. It will track changes that staged and unstaged, which include files adding and removing.
   5.9* git checkout: checkout the target version. "git checkout <hash>", go to the <hash> version. "git checkout master" return to the HEAD. 
        git checkout changed_file: drop unstage changes to the changed_file.
        git checkout <branch>: switch to a local branch.
        git checkout <tag>: switch to a tag version.
   5.10* git tag: tag one version of the working copy. "git tag V1", "git checkout V1".
   5.11 git revert: to revert a published commit. For example: git revert HEAD --no-edit.
        git reset --soft HEAD^: used to revert local commit, your change will keep. 
	git reset --hard HEAD^: your change will lose.
   5.12 git config: configure git environent. For example: git config --global alias.co "checkout": set alias co=checkout in git. We can set a shortcut for the log command in 5.1
   5.13 git branch branch1: to create branch1 on the HEAD of master branch(Actually, it's the current head of current branch).
   5.14 git merge branch1: merge branch1 to current branch. 
   5.15 git rebase branch1: merge branch1 to current branch, and commit history will also merged together to current branch.
   5.16* git push origin master: push local committed changes to the master brach of remote/origin repo.
   5.17* git clone remote_repo local_repo: after clone, the remote/origin of local_repo is refer to remote_repo
   5.18 git cat-file -t <hash>, git cat-file -p <hash>: to type, dump objects contents referred by the <hash>



6. Something you should know
   6.1 target of a commit is the staged changes, not the whole changed file.
   6.2 ~/.gitconfig stores the global git configuration
   6.3 repo/.git/object, stores the git objects, the name is the first two letter of the sha1 hash of the objects.
   6.4 repo/.git/config, project-specific configuration
   6.5 repo/.git/refs, stored the reference of head and tags. And the .git/HEAD is referred to .git/refs/head/master
   6.6 git clone --bare my_local_project share_my_local_project.git: will copy a shared only repo, it only contain the contents in .git of the my_local_project repo. So you can't work directly in the xxx.git repo.
   6.7 /usr/share/git-core/templates, it include some template for high-level git usage.

Appendix-I. "~/.gitconfig" example:
[alias]
	co = checkout
	ci = commit -a
	st = status
	br = branch
	hist = log --pretty=format:\"%h %ad | %s%d [%an]\" --graph --date=short
	type = cat-file -t
	dump = cat-file -p
	ps = push origin master
	up = pull
[user]
	name = Chen Gang-Cuble
	email = fouryu@sina.com.cn


Appendix-II other git commands:
git hist --all: to show log of all the branches in the local repo.
git remote add share another_remote_repo: to add another remote to local repo.
git reset --hard <hash>: to drop commit permanently.
