1. To ignore generated files added to the git repo
  - add files you want to ignore into .gitignore in the repo

2. To do automatic compile after commit
  - To detect if src file changed

3. To check the change in GUI
  - gitk [file]

4. There are three level git config values: /etc/gitconfig, ~/.gitconfig, ./.git/config
  - git config --system
  - git config --global
  - git config

5. git log --pretty=format:"options", options as following:
    %H  Commit hash
    %h  Abbreviated commit hash
    %T  Tree hash
    %t  Abbreviated tree hash
    %P  Parent hashes
    %p  Abbreviated parent hashes
    %an Author name
    %ae Author e-mail
    %ad Author date (format respects the –date= option)
    %ar Author date, relative
    %cn Committer name
    %ce Committer email
    %cd Committer date
    %cr Committer date, relative
    %s  Subject
  filter options for git log:
    --since, --after, --util, --before,  --author, --committer, --grep(used to grep commit message), -(n) (show only last n commits)
	--all-match, this option is needed in some condition to make filter by all given conditions
	file name or path can be given to filter logs that contain the selected files change information. '--' is used to split files or path from options
	example: git log --since=2012-10-1 --before=2013-10-1 -- README
	
6. git remote:
  - git remote -v
  - git remote add [name] [url]
  - git remote show [name], show branch information of remote and related configuration locally
  - git remote rename [orgName] [newName], git remote rm [name]
  
7. git tag
  - git tag -l 'v1.4.2.*', used to list all the tags start with v1.4.2.
  - git tag -a [tagName] -m [message], to add a annotated tag. git tag -a [tagName] -m [message] [commitChecksum] can be used to tag a old commit.
  - git tag -s [tagName] -m [message], to add a signed tag, which can be verified by 'git tag -v [tagName]'
  - git tag [tagName], create a lightweight tag which create a file referred to the commit checksum.
  - git push origin [tagName], to push the tag to origin server. git push origin --tags to push all tags to origin server.
  
8. tips:
  - make auto completion work for git: source git-completion.bash. 'git-completion.bash' located in git source code's contrib/completion. add the command into .bashrc to make it auto configured. Or copy it to /etc/bash_completion.d/ to make it auto configured for all uses.
  - git config --global alias.visual '!gitk', to make 'git visual' load external command 'gitk'.

9. work with branch
  - git checkout -b issuexx, create a new branch named issuexx from HEAD and checkout it
    - git checkout -b issuexx origin/issuexx, to create local issuexx branch base on remote issuexx and check it out
	  - git checkout --track origin/issuexx, the same as up command
  - git branch issueyy, create a branch named issueyy from HEAD
    - git branch, show all branchs 
	- git branch -v, show HEAD information of all branchs
	- git branch --merged(--no-merged), to filter branches concerning whether the content of the branch merged to current branch(master)
  - git merge issueyy, merge branch issueyy into current HEAD
  - git mergetool, to laugch visule merge tool when conflict found after merge
  - git branch -d [branchName], to delete a branch
    - git branch -D [branchName], to force delete a branch, which not one of the ancestor of the HEAD(not merged yet)
  - git push [remoteName] [branchName], to push local branch to remote
    - git push [remoteName] [localBranch]:[remoteBranch], to push local branch to remote and reset name
    - git push [remoteName] :[branchName], to remove a remote branch
  - git rebase [baseBranch]: merge current branch to base branch in rebase manner
    - git rebase [baseBranch] [topicBranch]: merge topic branch to base branch in rebase manner
    - git rebase --onto [targetBranch] [baseBranch] [topicBranch]: merge topic branch's content, which not in the base branch, to target branch in rebase manner

10. Create git server
  - SSH protocal: all you need is a SSH server and a bare repository, which users can access
    - Authenticate with file access need to setup accounts on SSH server one by one
	- Authenticate with SSH access
	  - create user 'git' on SSH server, and create file ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	  - collecting pub keys of users, and add them into the authorized_keys, cat id_rsa.userxx.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	  - userxx do: git remote add origin git@gitserver:/path/to/project.git, check if git works
	  - disable shell of user 'git': change user's shell in /etc/passwd from '/bin/bash' to '/usr/bin/git-shell', test it by: 'ssh git@gitserver'
  - HTTP protocal: 
    - Apache Server
	- gitweb
  - Git Server Management: gitosis, gitolite
  - Git Protocal:
  

11. Work modes
  - Peer group
    - git clone [remote] [localdir], work on master
        - git commit -am [msg]
        - git push origin master, do following thing if be rejected
        - git fetch origin
        - git merge origin/master, then push

    - git branch issuexx, work on issuexx
        - git fetch origin,
        - git log --no-merges origin/master ^issuexx, check others' change
        - git checkout master, git merge issuexx, git merge origin/master, then push

  - Peer groups with dedicate integrate manager
    - git checkout -b FeatureA, work on FeatureA
        - you can switch to FeatureA if you have worked on other branch, git checkout FeatureA
        - git fetch origin
        - git merge origin/FeatureA, OR "git merge origin/FeatrueApp" in case remote branch is FeatrueApp
        - git push origin FeatureA, OR "git push origin FeatureA:FeatureApp" in case remote branch is FeatureApp
        - After FeatureA ready, the integrater manager will do following things:
            - git fetch origin
            - git merge origin/FeatureA, maybe also "git merge origin/FeatureB" in case other features ready too
            - git push origin master
  - Commit though integrate manager by git commits
    - clone the project and work on local FeatureA branch, fork it remotely
        - git add remote myfork (url)
        - git push myfork FeatureA
        - git request-pull origin/master myfork, email the maintainer the output of the command
        - git checkout -b FeatrueB origin/master, then work on another feature
        - if the integrate manager reject your contribution because your commit need to be merged to the latest master branck
            - git checkout FeatureA
            - git rebase origin/master, and resolve the conflicts
            - git push -f myfork FeatureA
        - if the integrate manager reject your contribution because he/she has some comments on your solution, you can rework it as following
            - git checkout FeatureBv2 origin/master
            - git merge --no-commit --squash FeatureB, "--squash" used to digger the change, and "--no-commit" make git not to commit automatically. 
            - work, and git commit
            - git push myfork FeatureBv2
  - Commit though integrate manager by patch e-mails
    - git checkout -b topicxxx, work on it and commit, then generate and send the patch.
        - git format-patch -M origin/master, "-M" is used to make git find renames.
        - copy the patch in the generated .patch files and send the mail, or do following
        - git send-email *.patch
            - before send mail, parameters: folder, host, user, pass, port, sslverify, need to be configured with "git config" 

  - Work as integrate manager
    - apply patchs, generated by "git diff" or "diff", with temporary evaluate using branch
        - git checkout -b sc/topicxx master
        - git apply /tmp/patch-topicxx.patch, you also can do "git apply --check /tmp/patch-topicxx.path" beforehand
    - apply patchs generated by "git format-patch"
        - git am 0001-topicxx-msg.patch, you can solve conflictions by following means
            - git am -3 0001-topicxx-msg.patch, which do a three-way merge, or
            - fix conflict manually and do "git add [conflict_files]", "git am --resolved"
        - "-i" is to do "am" at interactive mode, it's especially useful when applying several patchs from a folder
    - determine what introduced
        - git merge-base issuexx master, used to find the common ancestor
        - git diff master...issuexx, use this to find what has changed in both branch from the common ancester.
        
  - some utilities related to release:
    - git provide a means to exchange public keys with gpg.
    - git describe master, can be used to generate a build number
    - git archive master --prefix='project/'| gzip > `git describe master`.tar.gz
        - or, git archive master --prefix='project/' --format=zip
    - git shortlog --no-merges master --not v1.0.1, can be used to generate change log since release v1.0.1
    
12. git tools
  - select revisions:
    - git log master..topicxxx, show revisions in topicxxx that has not merged into master. 
        - git log origin/master..HEAD, use it to check what will be pushed to origin/master in the coming push command
        - git log refA..refB == git log ^refA refB == git log refB --not refA
    - git log master...topicxxx, it will show what have changed in master and topicxxx since their common ancestor.
        - git log --left-right master...topicxxx, it will distinct master and topicxxx comits.
  - temporary store changes with stash
    - git stash, save changes to temporary stash
        - git stash list, to see what have stored
    - git stash apply, to apply the file changes in the latest stash, note apply won't delete stash automatically
        - git stash apply --index, apply both file changes and indexing status in the stash.
    - git stash drop stash@{n}, to delete the nth stash 
        - git stash pop, apply the latest stash and delete it
    - git stash show -p | git apply -R, can be used to unapply the stash apply
        - git config --global alias.stash-unapply '!git stash show -p | git apply -R'
    - git stash branch brxxx, create brxxx from stash stored commit and apply the stash, it's recommanded for handle complex stash contents.
  - modify history commits contents
    - git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD
    - git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter trunk HEAD
    - modify e-mail address in commits:
        git filter-branch --commit-filter '
            if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "schacon@localhost" ];
            then
                    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Scott Chacon";
                    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="schacon@example.com";
                    git commit-tree "$@";
            else
                    git commit-tree "$@";
            fi' HEAD
  - Check commit history by code lines
    - git blame -L 12,22 readme.txt, to show commits which has touched line 12 to 22 of readme.txt
    - git blame -C -L 14,24 xxxip.c, to show the history of line 14 to 24 of xxxip.c, which include which file the code block was copied to.
  - Locate the bad version by bisect
    - git bisect start, to start the locate process
    - git bisect bad, to set current ref as BAD one
    - git bisect good v1.0, to set the v1.0 as a good ref, then git will checkout the the middle commit of current commit and v1.0.
        - after test on the middle commit, you can  set "git bisect good" or "git bisect bad" to continue the search until locate the commit which introduce the problem.
    - git bisect reset, NOTE, use it to terminate the bisect process, or you will end in weird state.
    - do bisect process automatically:
        - git bisect start HEAD v1.0
        - git bisect run test-error.sh
    
13. customize git
  - config
    - git config commit.template $HOME/.gitmessage.txt, to set the commit message template.
    - git config core.pager less, to set pager tool for git output when page output needed(such as long "git log"), default is less
    - git config user.signingkey <gpg-key-id>, set the key to be used when do signature
    - git config core.excludesfile '.gitignore'
    - git config help.autocorrect 1
    - git config color.ui=true
    - git config core.autocrlf true, it will transfer LF ending to CRLF automatically on windows when fetch file
        - git config core.autocrlf input, it will transfer CRLF to LF
        - git config core.autocrlf false, to disable the auto transfer
    - configure on server side:
        - git config --system receive.denyNonFastForwards true, to deny non-fastforward push even -f option given
        - git config --system receive.denyDeletes true, to deny delete operation, to keep public commits clean plus the previous configuration
        - git config --system receive.fsckObjects true, make server verify SHA-1 checksum when accepting pushes
  - git export and some other configurations can be configured in .gitattributes

14. Objects in git
  - git hash-object test.txt, or "cat test.txt|git hash-object --stin", to caculate hash value of file test.txt
    - git hash-object -w test.txt, caculate and store the hash value into .git/objects/, the value was stored with 2+n format, the first two bypts was the folder name, the remain n bytes is the file name
    - git cat-file -p [hashValue], to print the file contents related to the hash value.
        - git cat-file -t [hashValue], print the contents type of the hash value
        - git cat-file -p master^{tree}, print the tree object linked in the last commit of master branch
  - create tree object with update-index, write-tree and read-tree
    ?- git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt, add test.txt into staging area and create the tree
    - git write-tree, to record the staging area and the tree associated it
    - git read-tree --prefix=bak d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579, to read tree into staging area and name it as bak
  - commit object by commit-tree
    - echo 'first commit'|git commit-tree d8329f, it will create a commit object which contains 'autor', 'commit message', 'tree' objects. author is local git user.
        - echo 'second commit' | git commit-tree 0155eb -p fdf4fc3, to create the second commit and set the parent to the first one
            - git log [output of previous command] to see the commit history
            - the commit objects SHA-1 value will be recorded in .git/refs/xxxx for reference convenience, or
            - git update-ref refs/heads/master 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9, to make the reference yourself, and HEAD can be updated by
            - git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/master
  - tag object by update-ref or tag command
    - git update-ref /refs/tags/v1.0 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9, to create a tag as a link
    - git log -a v1.1 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 -m "version 1.1", to create a tag object which have objects like commit objects.
  - git gc, to pack objects manually to save disk space
    -git verify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-xxyadfasdfasdfa.idx, to check the pack result.
    
15. Refspec pattern is <src>:<dst>
  - git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster, <src> is master in remote(origin server), <dst> is .git/refs/remotes/origin/mymaster
    - several <src>:<dst> can be given
  - git push origin master:refs/heads/qa/master, <src> is local master, <dst> is remote ref, this can create a namespace "qa" in remote side!!!
    - git push origin :topic, to remove topic branch in remote(origin server), actually "topic" is "refs/heads/topic".
  - all those can be configured in [remote "origin"] sections in config file or by config command.
    - the + before <src> in config file means accept it even if not fast-forward move. without + non fast-forward will be rejected
    - the * can only be used as "/refs/heads/*", can't be used as "refs/heads/qa*", but we can create a "qa" namesapce in remote side instead.

16. maintainance
  - git reflog, or "git log -g" to check the local HEAD change history
  - git fsck --full, to find out the refs that not been pointed to by other objects, which can help to find the lost commits.
  - remove big object that added by mistake
    - locate big object:
        - git count-objects -v, to check the totally disk usage
        - git gc, to do garbage collect
        - git varify-pack -v .git/objects/pack/pack-xxxxxxx...xxx.idx | sort -k 3 -n | tail, after "gc", to check if big object exist
        - git rev-list --objects --all|grep kkkk....kkkk, to find the file name of the blob object find by the previous command
        - git log --pretty=oneline -- [blob file name], to locate the commit history which have touched the big file
        - git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch [blob file name]' -- [start commit's sha-1]^.., to remove it
        - rm -Rf .git/refs/original; rm -Rf .git/logs, remove the original refs, which generated by filter-branch, and reflogs which contain the reference to the big file
        - git gc, do garbage collect again, to save disk space.
        - git prune --expire, to remove objects not been pointed to, do it you really wanted to.
