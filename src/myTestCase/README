myTestCase is an open source UT framework for Python. It's designed to 
simplify TDD with Python. It's derived from unittest.TestCase. 

Features:
	1. stdout is redirected in myTestCase, print result should be checked
	2. function stubed by myTestCase will be unstub automatically
	3. mock generation function and class function are supported  

To install:

  $ python setup.py install

To run myTestCase's internal tests:

  $ python runTest.py

Basic usage:

  import myTestCase

  class PersonTest(myTestCase.myTestCase):
	def my_setup(self):
		#do your specifical setup, don't use setUp
	  	pass
	 
	def my_teardown(self):
		#do your specifical teardown, don't use TearDown
		pass
	
	def test_functions_with_print(self):
		#print result should be checked, or case will fail
		print('hello world')
		self.check_output('hello world')
		pass
		
	def test_stub_a_function(self):
		pass
